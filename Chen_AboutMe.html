          <!--Small intro about me-->
          <p style="text-align:center">Hello! My name is Sihan Chen, and I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High School. I am interested in the the STEM field, and am currently 15 years old. Some hobbies I particularly enjoy are playing with Rubiks Cubes, reading novels, and playing video games. One other interest I have is chess. Some careers that interest me are anesthesiologist, architecture, and IT technician. Lastly, I enjoy learning languages, such as German and other European languages.

          <!--School achivements-->
          Some of my achievements within school are being awarded a plaque in Smarts Mill Middle School in my 7th grade year for "Outstanding German Student" and achieving the maximum score on the Grammar section for the SOL (Standards of Learning, essentially the final exam for middle schoolers in Virginia). IN addition to this, my applications to the Academy of Science (AOS) and Academy of Engineering and Technology (AET) in Virginia had both been accepted. Lastly, I had also won a schoolwide chess competition in my 7th grade year.
          <br>
          <br>
          <!--Hobbies-->
          I have a profound interest in solving Rubiks Cubes and its variations. In 5th grade, my friend had introduced me to the 3x3 (Rubiks Cube). Since then, I had bought multiple other cubes and variations and had learned to solve them over time, and still retain this hobby to this day. I also enjoy reading mystery and crime novels, in particular, James Patterson novels. I also do read Ridley Pearson's novels on certain occasions, but reading, regardless of author, is definitely something I enjoy very much.

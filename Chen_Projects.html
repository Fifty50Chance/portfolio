      <h4 style="text-align-center">Made by Sihan Chen</h4>
      <p style="text-align-center">In the Marble Maze Project, I was given a small box and a certain amount of cardboard. The instructions were to create a small game that would not only fit inside the box, but not use more than the amount of material given. Throughout the first stage of the project, I had learned to improve my Autodesk Inventor skills by designing the game within the program. In the second part of the project, my job was to create a physical copy of the game given the actual materials. Through this experience, I had learned skills such as measuring and cutting precisely, and improved upon my hand-eye coordination skills.

      <h4 style="text-align:center;">Made by Sihan Chen and Pradnya Kadam</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center;">In this project, Kadam and I had used the MIT App Inventor tutorial in order to construct the basic outline of code for the game. However, we were not fully satisfied with the final product that MIT App Inventor offered, so through collaboration and hard work, we were able to add additional features, such as adding a speed the ball must be going under in order to go into the hole, a main menu, and changing the shape and color of the barrier.

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">PalmPilot Project</h2>
      <h4 style="text-align:center;">Made by Sihan Chen</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center;">In the PalmPilot project, I had to measure the parts of a PalmPilot and make one in Autodesk Inventor based off my measurements on the physical product. Through these experiences, I learned to measure things accurately and further improved my Autodesk Inventor skills, but the most important skill I had learned was to improvise and adapt, because the measurements could not always be perfect so the product within Inventor was not perfect either, and so I had to modify some measurements within Autodesk slightly to achieve my desired final product. Below is a picture is a picture of the PalmPilot in Autodesk Inventor.
